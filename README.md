# Sinfall 🌲🌑

Hey there! Welcome to the repo for Sinfall, a 2D rogue-like metroidvania I'm working on. The concept for the game's got a grimdark vibe and is set in a forest that's seen better days. I'm building this while learning JavaScript, so it's a bit of a playground for me right now.

## Live Demo

Check out the current state of the game [right here](https://ryanflynn-dev.github.io/Sinfall/).

## What's it About? 🤔

In Sinfall, you will play as a creature just trying to get by in a decaying ecosystem. You're not the hero, you're not the villain, you're just another part of the food chain. The game aims to mix platforming, combat and rogue-like features, all while you dodge hazards and maybe even complete a quest or two. The creatures in the game will learn and adapt, making each playthrough unique.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- JavaScript (I'm learning)
- Some HTML and CSS for good measure
- Maybe more to come as the project evolves

That's Sinfall in a nutshell, feel free to mess around with the code and correct my mistakes!
