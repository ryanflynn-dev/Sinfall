# Sinfall 🌲🌑

Hey there! Welcome to the repo for Sinfall, a 2D rogue-like platformer I'm working on. The game's got a grimdark vibe and is set in a forest that's seen better days. I'm building this while learning JavaScript, so it's a bit of a playground for me right now.

## Live Demo

Check out the current state of the game [right here](https://ryanflynn-dev.github.io/Sinfall/).

## What's it About? 🤔

In Sinfall, you play as a creature just trying to get by in a decaying ecosystem. You're not the hero, you're not the villain, you're just another part of the food chain. The game aims to mix platforming and combat, all while you dodge hazards and maybe even complete a quest or two. The creatures in the game will learn and adapt, making each playthrough unique.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- JavaScript (I'm learning)
- Some HTML and CSS for good measure
- Maybe more to come as the project evolves
